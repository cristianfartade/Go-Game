# Go-Game_ProiectPA
Fartade Cristian - 2B1
An implementation of the GO Game (work in progress)


Client-Server implementation using Spring and JavaFX
-The player that connected first gets the color black and will start by placing his stone
-Each player places one stone and then it's the other player's turn
-Players can place their own stone so that they capture opponent stones or surround as many intersections
-When both players choose not to place a stone anymore (they PASS) -> the game ends and scores are being computed and shown
-White has an initial advantage of 6.5 points because black places a stone first
